# Velocity optimization

![Velocity Optimization.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TUMFTM/velocity_optimization/master/vel.png)

Optimizes (Maximizes) the velocity profile for a vehicle in real-time respecting physical constraints (e.g., power,
force, combined acceleration, ...). Takes into account a variable friction potential between road and tires. Max.
power input can be space-variable (for, e.g., energy strategy purposes).
